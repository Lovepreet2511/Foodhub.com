Oh food, you’re more than mere delight,
You warm our hearts each day and night.
From morning toast to evening stew,
Life’s richer just because of you.

A sizzle, crunch, a steaming plate,
You teach us joy, you make us wait.
In every bite, a story told,
Of spices bold and memories old.

The sweet, the sour, the salty bliss,
The comfort found in every dish.
A feast with friends, a snack alone—
Through food, we’re always homeward grown.

So here’s to meals, both grand and small,
The universal love of all.
For in your taste, we always find
A little peace, a little kind.
